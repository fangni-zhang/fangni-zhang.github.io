Dr. Fangni Zhang will join the Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering at The University of Hong Kong as an Assistant Professor in February 2020. Prior to this, she held Lecturer positions at University of New South Wales and University of Leeds, and worked at Imperial College London as a Research Associate. Dr. Fangni Zhang’s research covers a wide range of fundamental or emerging issues in transport, including multimodal transport system modelling and optimization, shared and automated transport management, high-speed rail and air transport interactions, and wider economic impacts of transport. Her research draws tools from different disciplines such as network modeling, economic theory, traffic flow theory, operations research, and data science to transport research and has been published in a number of world-leading journals and conferences in the field (e.g., Transportation Research Part A, B, C, D, E).

Research interests
======
- Multimodal transport systems

PhD positions
------
- I am looking for 1-2 self-motivated Ph.D. students to join my research group. Applicants should have a B.S. or M.S. in Industrial Engineering, Transportation Engineering, Economics, Operations Research, Mathematics, and Computer Science or related fields. Strong oral and written communication skills in English are required. Candidates with research experience in network modeling, optimization and game theory are preferred.

- Successful applicants will be considered eligible to receive a Postgraduate Scholarship (the 2019/20 rate: HKD 17,330/month) during the normative study period. Outstanding applicants for the Ph.D. programme are strongly encouraged to apply for the Hong Kong PhD Fellowship scheme, which offers an annual stipend of HKD 25,800 /month plus a conference and research-related travel allowance of HKD 12,900 per year for a period of up to three years. More information regarding HKU Ph.D. scholarships is available at: [https://www.gradsch.hku.hk/gradsch/prospective-students/scholarship-funding-and-fees#2](https://www.gradsch.hku.hk/gradsch/prospective-students/scholarship-funding-and-fees#2)

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
